                    <p>Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people. A childâ€™s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born and the child's gender.</p>
